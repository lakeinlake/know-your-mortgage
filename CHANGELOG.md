## Version 2.4.0 - Census API Integration & Debugging (September 24, 2025)

### üîß **Technical Debugging & Integration**
**Successfully integrated and debugged the US Census API for real-time demographic data.**

#### ‚úÖ **Problem Summary**
- **Symptom**: Census API calls were failing with `204 No Content` responses despite a valid API key.
- **Scope**: The issue was present in both direct Python script testing (`temp_census_test.py`) and within the live Streamlit application.
- **Verification**: Logging confirmed the API key was being loaded correctly, but data retrieval failed.

#### ‚úÖ **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **API Key Loading Logic**: The key loading mechanism relied on a `if "streamlit" in globals()` check, which failed when running standalone Python scripts for testing, preventing the key from being loaded in that environment.
2. **Incorrect FIPS Codes**: The primary issue was the use of outdated or incorrect FIPS county codes for API queries.
   - **Carmel, IN**: Used `10588`, but the correct code is `10342`.
   - **Fishers, IN**: Used `23482`, but the correct code is `23278`.
3. **Hardcoded Test Data**: The test file (`temp_census_test.py`) contained the same hardcoded incorrect FIPS codes, leading to test failures.

#### ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**
1. **Robust API Key Loading**: A new function, `_load_census_api_key()`, was created. It establishes a reliable fallback chain: first checking Streamlit secrets, then environment variables, and finally a local `secrets.toml` file.
2. **Corrected FIPS Codes**: Researched and validated the correct FIPS codes using the official Census API search tools.
3. **Codebase Update**: Updated the main `src/data/census_api.py` module and the `temp_census_test.py` file with the correct FIPS codes.
4. **Full Verification**: Executed tests against the live Census API to confirm the fix and retrieve real data.

#### ‚úÖ **Validation & Results**
- Successfully retrieved 2022 demographic data from the Census API:
  - **Carmel, IN (2022)**:
    - Population: `99,453`
    - Median Household Income: `$132,859`
  - **Fishers, IN (2022)**:
    - Population: `99,041`
    - Median Household Income: `$126,548`

#### ‚úÖ **Technical Enhancements**
- **Improved Configuration Management**: Multi-source API key loading with graceful fallbacks
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Updated test scripts with correct parameters for reliable validation
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Market comparison page now uses official Census Bureau data instead of sample data
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive FIPS code research and debugging process documentation

## Version 2.3.0 - Rent vs Buy Analysis Bug Fixes & Core Logic Improvements (September 19, 2025)

### üêõ **Critical Bug Fixes**
**Fixed fundamental flaws in rent vs buy analysis that were showing incorrect results**

#### ‚úÖ **Rent vs Buy Analysis Corrections**
- **Bug**: Page was displaying "Year 1", "Rent", "$0" instead of real analysis results
- **Root Cause**: `calculate_break_even_analysis` method returned wrong data keys (`total_advantage` vs `advantage_at_30_years`)
- **Fix**: Updated method to return correct keys: `advantage_at_30_years`, `final_net_worth_difference`, `insights`

#### ‚úÖ **Chart Visualization Improvements**
- **Bug**: Charts showed "Buy line always higher than Rent line" making break-even points invisible
- **Root Cause**: Chart displayed absolute net worth values instead of differential comparison
- **Fix**: Updated chart to show net worth difference (Buy - Rent) with proper break-even visualization
- **Enhancement**: Added enhanced tooltips and visual indicators for break-even points

#### ‚úÖ **Parameter Realism Updates**
- **Bug**: Default parameters showed buying always better from Year 1 with unrealistic $171K advantages
- **Root Cause**: Monthly rent ($2,500) was too low compared to mortgage costs ($2,424)
- **Fix**: Updated default monthly rent from $2,500 to $2,650 for realistic comparisons
- **Validation**: Verified realistic Year 1 renting advantage due to upfront buying costs

#### ‚úÖ **Fundamental Analysis Logic Overhaul**
- **Critical Issue**: Original analysis missing key homeownership costs and proper investment logic
- **Missing Costs**: Homeowner's insurance ($150/month), maintenance (1% annually), growing property taxes
- **Missing Logic**: Rent scenario not properly investing monthly savings differential
- **Missing Costs**: No selling costs (6%) included in final calculations

#### ‚úÖ **New Corrected Analysis Method**
- **Implementation**: Added `run_corrected_rent_vs_buy_analysis()` method to `mortgage_analyzer.py`
- **Comprehensive Costing**: Includes ALL homeownership costs (insurance, maintenance, property taxes)
- **Fair Investment Logic**: Both scenarios properly invest monthly savings for whichever option is cheaper
- **Realistic Selling Costs**: 6% selling costs included in final net worth calculations
- **Enhanced Insights**: Generates meaningful insights about break-even timeline and financial impact

#### ‚úÖ **Page Integration Updates**
- **Updated**: `pages/3_üè¢_Rent_vs_Buy.py` to use corrected analysis method
- **Data Structure**: Fixed data extraction to properly handle corrected results format
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with existing chart visualization code
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate methods and debugging code

#### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- **Realistic Results**: Year 1 renting advantage ($2,164), Year 2 break-even, realistic long-term buying benefits
- **Proper Cost Modeling**: Insurance, maintenance, and property taxes calculated accurately
- **Investment Growth**: Fair comparison with proper monthly savings investment for both scenarios
- **Final Calculations**: Includes 6% selling costs for accurate net worth comparison

#### üìä **Validation Results**
- **Year 1**: Renting better by $2,164 (realistic due to upfront costs)
- **Break-even**: Year 2 (much more realistic timeline)
- **Year 10**: Buying advantage $112,152 (reasonable long-term benefit)
- **30-Year**: Buying advantage $275,869 (includes all costs and selling fees)
