# Know Your Mortgage - Claude Code Instructions

## üöÄ Version 2.5.0 - Major Enhancement: Rent vs Buy Analysis Transformation (September 29, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Technical Summary: Complete Rent vs Buy Analysis Overhaul**
- **Problem**: Rent vs Buy page lacked clear decision guidance, had complex multi-state UI, and missing mathematical explanations
- **Major Improvements**:
  1. **Indiana-Focused Cleanup**: Removed complex 50-state UI, hardcoded Indiana tax rates (3.23% state, 0.87% property)
  2. **"The Verdict" Decision System**: Timeline-based recommendations (buy/rent/close call) using break-even vs planned stay analysis
  3. **Dual Buying Power Calculator**: Shows what rent can afford for both 15-year (~$220K) and 30-year (~$370K) loans
  4. **Enhanced Mathematical Explanations**:
     - Break-even methodology with year-by-year breakdown tables
     - Parabolic equation analysis (`at¬≤ + bt + c`) explaining curve shape
     - Stock return impact on curve curvature (10% = narrow, 5% = wide, 3% = linear)
  5. **Dynamic Chart Timeline**: Smart defaults (break-even + 5 years) with user slider control
  6. **Self-Explanatory Analysis**: Clear explanations of how "Year 2 break-even" is calculated

### ‚úÖ **New Unique Features (Not in Mortgage Analysis)**
- **Timeline Input**: "How many years do you plan to stay?" for personalized recommendations
- **Rent-to-Purchase Power**: "Your $2,500 rent could buy a $370K home" with detailed math
- **5-Year Wealth Impact**: Medium-term comparison vs 30-year focus
- **Mathematical Education**: Quadratic equation breakdown with coefficient explanations

### ‚úÖ **Technical Architecture**
- **Removed Dependencies**: Eliminated `create_tax_sidebar()`, `create_common_sidebar()`, `create_rent_sidebar()`
- **Enhanced Functions**: `calculate_rent_to_purchase_power()` now returns both 15-year and 30-year results
- **Smart Calculations**: Dynamic chart range, break-even explanation with user parameters
- **Gemini Validation**: Rent-to-purchase formula mathematically verified, caveats properly contextualized

## üöÄ Version 2.4.1 - UI Cleanup: Mortgage Analysis Page Streamlining (September 29, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Technical Summary: Mortgage Analysis Page Optimization**
- **Problem**: Duplicate and redundant information in the Detailed Analysis tabs section.
- **Removed Tabs**:
  1. **"Interest & Amortization"**: Redundant with Total Interest Comparison bar chart in main analysis
  2. **"Investment vs Extra Interest"**: Duplicated Net Worth Break-Even analysis from Metric 4
  3. **"Home Equity Building"**: Redundant with comprehensive Net Worth Break-Even visualization
- **Result**: Streamlined from 4 tabs to 1 essential "Year-by-Year Data" tab
- **Verification**: Total Interest calculation verified as correct using standard amortization formula
- **Benefits**: Cleaner UX, eliminated duplicate charts, preserved all unique insights

## üöÄ Version 2.4.0 - Census API Integration & Debugging (September 24, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Technical Summary: Census API Debugging**
- **Problem**: API calls returned `204 No Content` despite valid API key configuration.
- **Root Causes**:
  1. **Flawed Key Loading**: `if "streamlit" in globals()` logic failed in non-Streamlit test environments.
  2. **Incorrect FIPS Codes**: Used wrong county codes (e.g., `10588` for Carmel instead of `10342`).
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Robust Key Function**: Implemented `_load_census_api_key()` with fallback chain (Streamlit secrets ‚Üí environment variables ‚Üí local file).
  2. **Corrected FIPS**: Updated all files with correct FIPS codes for Carmel (`10342`) and Fishers (`23278`).
- **Result**: Successfully fetched real-time population and income data from the Census API.
- **Verification**: Carmel (Pop: 99,453, Income: $132,859), Fishers (Pop: 99,041, Income: $126,548)

## Project Architecture v2.3.0 - MAJOR REFACTORING

### üèóÔ∏è **NEW: Clean 3-Step Architecture Pattern**
All pages now follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Initialize**: `initialize()` - Set up session state
2. **Render UI**: `UIComponents.create_*_sidebar()` - Build UI from dedicated class
3. **Get Values**: `AppState.get_*()` - Retrieve computed data from state

### üéØ **NEW: Separation of Concerns**
- **`src/utils/state_manager.py`**: Manages all application state
  - `SafeSessionState` - Guaranteed safe access patterns for Streamlit's session
  - `AppState` - Handles state logic, data processing, and initialization
- **`src/utils/ui_components.py`**: Centralizes all UI rendering
  - `UIComponents` - A dedicated class for creating sidebars and other UI elements
- **`src/data/tax_data.py`**: Holds all static data
  - Static tax rates, property tax averages, and federal tax brackets
- **`src/utils/shared_components.py`**: Contains shared business logic and utility functions

### ‚úÖ **Architectural Benefits Achieved**
- **Single responsibility**: Each module has one job (state, UI, data)

## üöÄ Version 2.3.0 - RENT VS BUY ANALYSIS BUG FIXES (September 19, 2025)

### üêõ **Critical Bug Resolution: Rent vs Buy Analysis**
**Fixed fundamental flaws that were displaying incorrect results**

#### ‚úÖ **Primary Issues Resolved**
1. **Data Display Bug**: Page showing "Year 1", "Rent", "$0" instead of real analysis
2. **Wrong Data Keys**: Method returned `total_advantage` but UI expected `advantage_at_30_years`
3. **Chart Visualization**: Charts showed absolute values making break-even points invisible
4. **Parameter Realism**: Default rent ($2,500) vs mortgage ($2,424) made buying always appear better
5. **Missing Costs**: Analysis excluded homeowner insurance, maintenance, and selling costs
6. **Investment Logic**: Rent scenario not properly investing monthly savings differential

#### ‚úÖ **Technical Implementation**
1. **New Corrected Method**: Added `run_corrected_rent_vs_buy_analysis()` to `mortgage_analyzer.py`
2. **Comprehensive Costing**: Includes insurance ($150/month), maintenance (1% annually), property taxes
3. **Fair Investment Logic**: Both scenarios invest monthly savings for whichever option is cheaper
4. **Realistic Selling Costs**: 6% selling costs included in final calculations
5. **Page Integration**: Updated `pages/3_üè¢_Rent_vs_Buy.py` to use corrected method
6. **Data Structure Fix**: Proper extraction of break-even analysis from corrected results

#### ‚úÖ **Validation Results**
- **Year 1**: Renting better by $2,164 (realistic due to upfront costs)
- **Break-even**: Year 2 (much more realistic than "always better")
- **Year 10**: Buying advantage $112,152 (reasonable long-term benefit)
- **30-Year**: Buying advantage $275,869 (includes all costs and selling fees)

#### ‚úÖ **Quality Improvements**
- **Realistic Modeling**: All homeownership costs properly accounted for
- **Enhanced Insights**: Generates 3 meaningful insights about analysis results
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate methods and debugging code
- **Chart Accuracy**: Differential plotting shows true break-even points

## üöÄ Version 2.2.0 - MAJOR ARCHITECTURE REFACTORING (September 18, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Completed: Comprehensive Architectural Cleanup**
**Transformed from monolithic session management to clean separation of concerns**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Code is now cleanly split between state, UI, and data
   - `state_manager.py` for all state logic
   - `ui_components.py` for all UI rendering
   - `tax_data.py` for all static data
2. **Eliminated `session_manager.py`**: The old, monolithic module was removed
3. **Clean 3-Step Pattern**: All pages follow a consistent Initialize ‚Üí Render ‚Üí Get Values approach
4. **Fixed Import Paths**: All imports were updated to reflect the new modular structure
5. **Resolved Duplicate Keys**: Centralized UI generation prevents Streamlit widget key conflicts
6. **Streamlit-Idiomatic**: Works with framework conventions, not against them

### üéØ **Architecture Quality Achieved**
- **Maintainable**: Single place to modify UI, state, or data logic
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new pages, parameters, or UI components
- **Consistent**: Uniform patterns across the entire application
- **Robust**: No race conditions or state management conflicts
- **Clean**: Proper separation of concerns (state, UI, data, business logic)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Refactoring Process Completed**
- **Problem Analysis**: Identified code duplication and architectural inconsistencies
- **Solution Design**: Developed clean 3-step pattern with centralized state management
- **Implementation**: Systematic refactoring of all pages and components
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all functionality
- **Documentation**: Updated development guides and architectural notes
