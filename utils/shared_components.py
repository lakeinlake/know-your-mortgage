    ## üéØ First-Time Home Buyer Golden Rules

    **üí∞ Down Payment Guidelines:**
    - Put down 20% to avoid PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)
    - Minimum: 3-5% for conventional loans, 3.5% for FHA
    - More down payment = lower monthly payments but less money to invest

    **üö® Emergency Fund Rules:**
    - Keep 3-6 months of expenses in emergency fund
    - For homeowners: 6-12 months recommended (maintenance costs)
    - Don't use emergency fund for down payment!

    **üìä Debt-to-Income Guidelines:**
    - Total monthly debts should be ‚â§ 43% of gross income
    - Housing costs should be ‚â§ 28% of gross income
    - Lower ratios = better loan terms

    **üè† Additional Costs to Budget:**
    - Property taxes (1-3% of home value annually)
    - Homeowners insurance ($1,000-3,000/year)
    - Maintenance (1-3% of home value annually)
    - HOA fees (if applicable)
    - Utilities and moving costs

    **üéØ Smart Home Buying Strategy:**
    1. Get pre-approved for a mortgage first
    2. Shop around for best rates (get 3+ quotes)
    3. Consider total cost of ownership, not just monthly payment
    4. Don't buy at the top of your budget - leave room for surprises
    5. Think long-term: Will you stay 5+ years?
    6. Factor in your commute and lifestyle needs

    **üì± This Tool Helps You:**
    - Compare different down payment strategies
    - Understand PMI costs and when to avoid them
    - See real vs nominal values (inflation-adjusted)
    - Compare buying vs renting financially
    - Calculate appropriate emergency fund levels
    - Export professional reports for planning

        **üè† PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)**
        - Required when down payment < 20%
        - Protects lender if you default
        - Typically 0.3% - 1.5% of loan amount annually
        - Can be removed once you have 20% equity

        **üìä LTV (Loan-to-Value Ratio)**
        - Loan amount √∑ home value
        - Lower LTV = better loan terms
        - 80% LTV = 20% down payment
        - Used to determine PMI requirement

        **üèòÔ∏è HOA (Homeowners Association)**
        - Monthly/annual fees for community amenities
        - Can range from $50-500+ per month
        - Covers maintenance, amenities, insurance
        - Factor into total monthly housing cost

        **üèõÔ∏è FHA Loan**
        - Federal Housing Administration loan
        - Lower down payment (3.5% minimum)
        - More flexible credit requirements

        - Back-end DTI: All debts (‚â§43%)
        - Lower DTI = better loan approval odds

        **üìà APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**
        - True cost of borrowing including fees
        - Higher than interest rate due to fees

        **üî¢ Principal & Interest**
        - Principal: Amount borrowed
        - Interest: Cost of borrowing money
        - Early payments go mostly to interest

        **üè¶ Escrow Account**
        - Lender holds money for taxes/insurance
        - Paid as part of monthly mortgage
