   - Check the summary table with rankings
   - Explore detailed tabs for deeper insights

3. **Export Data**:
   - Click "Generate CSV Export" for full data
   - Use "Generate Summary Report" for a text summary

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the `MortgageAnalyzer` class directly in Python:

```python
from mortgage_analyzer import MortgageAnalyzer, MortgageScenario

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = MortgageAnalyzer(home_price=500000)

# Create a custom scenario
scenario = MortgageScenario(
    name="Custom 20-Year",
    home_price=500000,
    down_payment=100000,
    loan_amount=400000,
    interest_rate=0.055,
    term_years=20,
    stock_return_rate=0.08,
    inflation_rate=0.03
)

# Analyze the scenario
results = analyzer.analyze_scenario(scenario)

# View results
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${results['monthly_payment']:,.2f}")
print(f"Total Interest: ${results['total_interest']:,.2f}")
print(f"Final Net Worth (Real): ${results['final_net_worth_adjusted']:,.2f}")
```

## üìà Scenarios Analyzed

The tool compares four primary scenarios:

### 1. 30-Year Mortgage with $100K Down
- Longest term, lowest monthly payment
- Maximum leverage for investment opportunities
- Higher total interest paid

### 2. 15-Year Mortgage with $100K Down
- Shorter term, higher monthly payment
- Faster equity building
- Significant interest savings

### 3. 15-Year Mortgage with $200K Down
- Lower loan amount, moderate monthly payment
- Reduced interest costs
- Less capital for investments

### 4. Cash Purchase
- No mortgage payments or interest
- Immediate full equity
- Opportunity cost of capital

## üìä Calculation Methodology

### Monthly Payment Formula
```
P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
```
Where:
- P = Monthly payment
- L = Loan amount
- c = Monthly interest rate
- n = Number of payments

### Investment Growth
- Compound interest with monthly contributions
- Tax-advantaged account assumptions
- Reinvestment of tax savings from mortgage deduction

### Inflation Adjustment
- Converts nominal values to real purchasing power
- Uses compound inflation over analysis period
- Critical for long-term comparisons
